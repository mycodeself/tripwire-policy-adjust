# tripwire policy adjust

A simple script for clean the default tripwire policy removing the nonexistent directories/files

## Usage

First we need to generate a file output with nonexistent files/directories with tripwire
```sh
$ tripwire -m i > /tmp/ouput
```

Give execution permission to script
```sh
$ chmod +x twpa.py
```

Run script 
```sh
$ ./twpa.py /tmp/output /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
```

Note: the script uses two params, first one the output file generated by tripwire and second one with policy to adjust.

Example output:
```sh
$ ./twpa.py /tmp/output /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
175 nonexistent files found in twpol.txt
Creating new policy file...
File /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt.adjusted was created successfully.
```
